#### Pump

Water cooled spindles systems should use distilled water with an anti-corrosion additive. 
I picked [Inhibited Propylene Glycol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene_glycol) due to its
low-ish toxicity. You mix it with water (and I must admit I just used the tap). You can get the stuff at Napa auto.

A pump came with the 6040, but you still need a reservoir to hold the
coolant. I made mine out of a plastic bucket and some panel-mount barb
fittings: 1 x [BHU2204](http://quickcouplings.net/osc/product_info.php?products_id=1080&osCsid=8e12c1e2b70df5345fca6878b4a5c1a3) 
and 1 x [BHU2206](http://quickcouplings.net/osc/product_info.php?products_id=1081). 
Beware the aluminum barbs that come with the pump - mine let
go in the middle of a cut and sprayed coolant all over. Now that
barb is reinforced with hose clamps.

One remaining issue: my pump does not always turn on when I hit the
switch. I don't think the problem is on the pump side, so I may need to
replace the switch. Will report back with my findings.
