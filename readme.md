### Rationale

I'm one of the co-creators of DIYLILCNC, a project that aims to make
CNC more accessible to artists, designers and makers. We started right
around the same time as Makerbot, and we all know now that cheap 3D printing
won out in a big way. CNC milling is harder, requiring more steps and
technical know-how. But it's also more rewarding, as the resulting
objects maintain the solidity and character of the materials they are
carved from.

The first two DIYLILCNC kits were intended for folks that were willing to trade
accuracy for cost/accessiblity. Now that those two designs are out in
the world, I got interested in attempting a build with a heavier metal gantry.

### Suppliers

You can find full kits or just mechanicals (gantry with no motors, spindle or
electrical control) on Amazon, Ebay and Aliexpress. I was surprised to
find that Aliexpress was not the cheapest route. A few sellers
maintain warehouses in the US, but shipping on heavy items tended to be
pretty pricey. This site helped me compare search terms on ebay to find
the best deal. I searched for "6040 CNC".

Many reviewers indicate that
the control systems that come with these machines are no good. Many have
[done this before](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/china-cnc-6040-setup-testing-review/?PHPSESSID=0521816f3f32ad12d44d4c11fb0a35c8) 
so we don't have to go into things totally blind. I'm also trying to find a Chinese supplier with a warehouse located in the US.

### Terminology

Tabletop mills are often listed with a four-digit number like 6040 (~24" x 15.5"). This refers to the XY work area in cm. 
57 = NEMA 23

### Features

Axes - minimum of 3. The fourth axis is rotational and allows for lathe-like milling of cylindrical objects.  
Spindle -  power is listed in watts. Fancier spindles have more power and are water cooled.  
Slides - cylindrical vs linear(?) 
Drive - trapezoidal vs ballscrew

### Residency

Machine on eBay 
New controller (tinyG) 
Getting the kit to and from Owego (combo of shipping and luggage)

### Assembly  

Place X axis beam in Y axis brackets 
Use mallet to tap into place (to avoid stripping tapped holes) 
Bolt from sides and bottom 
Attach motors. 
 *Take care to orient each wire harness towards its corresponding cable run 
 *Orient each standoff block to allow easiest allen key access
 
### Maintenance

Water cooled spindles systems should use distilled water with an anti-corrosion additive. I picked Inhibited Propylene Glycol due to its low toxicity. 
Planning to try pneumatic oil for ballscrew lubrication. There appears to be much debate on the best solution (grease vs oil etc.) 
Buckethead vac for dust management?
